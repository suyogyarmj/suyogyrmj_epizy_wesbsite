<p class = "normal">The following article is a simplified version of the news article stated in the source section of this webpage.</p>


<p class = "normal">1) How is Corona Virus spreading?</p>

<p class = "normal">Corona virus has been found to be a supreme version of SARS. Primary reason for the spread of the virus has been found to be contact with the respiratory droplets of symptomatic people (people exhibiting the symptoms of) in a direct or indirect (contact with contaminated surfaces) manner. </p>

<p class = "normal">2) How contagiuos is Corona Virus? </p>

<p class = "normal">According to studies, a single person infected with Corona virus has been found to infect 14 others. Thus, creating an exponential growth of patients. Corona virus has also been found to be extremely transmissible via contaminated surfaces. </p>

<p class = "normal">3) How much spread is from asymptomatic (shwowing no symptoms) cases? </p>

<p class = "normal">Studies have shown that only 6% to 13% of the total cases have been attributed to asymptomatic transmission. Despite not being a major culprit in transmission of the virus, control measures need to be taken for asymptomatic spread as well due the exponential spread of the virus. </p>

<p class = "normal">4) What is the false-negative rate on properly collected nasopharyngeal (Related to upper part of the pharynx, connecting with the nasal cavity) sample? </p>

<p class = "normal">This area is still being researched upon. It is highly dependent on how well the sample was taken. Neither FDA (Food & Drug Administration), nor CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) have come to a proper conclusion. </p>

<p class = "normal"> 5) How accurate is serology (the scientific study or diagnostic examination of blood serum, especially with regard to the response of the immune system to pathogens or introduced substances)? </p>

<p class = "normal">Accuracy of serology has also been found to be dependent on how well it has been done. Only 40% of the patients showed the presence of antibodies against the virus in less than a week and almnost 100% of patients after 15 days. We still are inconclusive if the antibodies prevent against repeat infection or the duration of the protection.</p>

<p class = "normal">6) How deadly is the Corona Virus?</p>

<p class = "normal">Case fatality rate has been reporetd to be varied from country to country. Mortality rate is high amongst those aged above 60 (globally) and more amongst those aged above 65 (in the US). China, previously reported this rate to be above 10%, now only reports 0.7% case fatality rate.</p>

<p class = "normal">7) Which groups are the most vulnerable? </p>

<p class = "normal">As we read above, those above the age of 60 are considered high risk. People with chronic respiratory conditions, compromised immune systems, kidney/liver diseases, Diabetes (Type 1 or 2) and severe obesity are also considered a high risk group. There is not currently enough date on risk towards preganant women/newborns. </p>

<p class = "normal">8) Do different types of virus have different serverity?</p>

<p class = "normal">SARS-COV-2 is mutating at a rate similar to that of RNA viruses. Further research is being done on this subject cause there is possiblity that some of the difference seen in different areas could reflect on the change in virus genetics. </p>

<p class = "normal">9) What treatments work against COVID-19? </p>

<p class = "normal">Muliple researches are being done by WHO on this subject. The solidarity clinical trial being conducted is assessing various treatment options.  </p>

<p class = "normal">10) Can preventive medications be administered to prevent one from COVID 19? </p>

<p class = "normal">Researches are being conducted on this subject. As of now there are few candidates such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir but a definite conclusion has not been reached. </p>

<p class = "normal">11) Is there a way to prevent the onset of severe pneumonia amongst those affected by COVID 19? </p>

<p class = "normal"> 26 pneumonia patiens given a low-dose of methylprednisolone had faster improvement in lung function compared to those without. More clinical trials are being conducted on this subject. </p>

<p class = "normal">12) Will school closures make a difference? </p>

<p class = "normal">School closures may be of limited value as most children don't appear to get seriously ill if infected. Combined closures of home, school and workplace seems to have had the highest impact in transmission control. Currently, US is being wacthed upon by the world to learn regarding the effectiveness of the measures taken to control the transmission of the virus. </p>

<p class = "normal"> 13) How can creation of a safe and effective vaccine be accelerated? </p>

<p class = "normal">A global collaboration is needed for this matter. Proper data from everywhere needs to be collected and analysed. Multiple vaccines have been seen as a cadidate but a definite conclusion has not been reached. </p>
